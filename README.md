# Ethereum Contract Icons

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/MetaMask/ethereum-contract-icons.svg?style=svg)](https://circleci.com/gh/MetaMask/ethereum-contract-icons)

A mapping of checksummed ethereum addresses to images of those addresses' logos.

All address keys follow the [EIP 55 address checksum format](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/55).

Submit PRs to add valid logos, and obviously valid logos will be merged.
